# vuejs-basic-examples
This repo provides basic examples to get new people used to Vue.js.

## Introduction
These few examples are meant for being used to introduce new people to Vue.js. Therefore the files contain only styles, where absolutely necessary and the code is kept as basic as possible. Some parts of the code didn't follow the common best practice for reasons of simplicity and to keep it as concise as possible.

## Usage
Clone this repo and open the various files in your browser. The files include the latest Vue.js version by default, which is being served by unpkg.com (CDN).

## Contribution
Feel free to fork this repo, add examples, enhance the existing ones and open a PR to get it merged back. If you find anything now working properly, don't hesitate to open up an issue.
